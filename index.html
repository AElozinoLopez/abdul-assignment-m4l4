                <h2>About The Legend</h2>
                <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.</p>
                <p>He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.</p>
                <p>Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</p>
                <p>In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.</p>
                <p>Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname <span>&#8221;Missile Man.&#8220;</span></p>

                <p>Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.</p>
                <p>He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
                <p>From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister.</p>
                <p>His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community.</p>
                <p>In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. 
                    The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.</p>
                <p>Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from <span>40</span> universities. The Government of India honoured him with the <span>Padma Bhushan in 1981</span> and the <span>Padma Vibhushan in 1990</span> for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.</p>
                <p>In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.</p>

                <p>In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society &#8221;to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project&#8220;.</p>
